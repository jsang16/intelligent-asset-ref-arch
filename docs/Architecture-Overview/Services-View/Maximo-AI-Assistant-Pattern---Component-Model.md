| MAS User-uploaded | <p>The Maximo Application Suite allows users to sign on to a single, integrated platform to access key monitoring, maintenance, and reliability applications across the business. Not only does it help remove data silos, it enhances data sharing with integrated user experience and shared administrative controls for enterprise-scale execution. With a new Committed Term License, businesses can access the entire suite with one single entitlement. Users in the organization will have a pool of AppPoints that will allow them to seamlessly move from one application to another, as needed. This enables organizations to pay for only what they use. You can try and deploy new applications without substantial license and administration costs. It also allows your team to deploy new capabilities and grow as well as share industry specific Digital Twin assets and modules.</p> | Human | <div><strong>SubSystem,Maximo Application Suite Core</strong>[Auto-Generated]</div><div>This group is derived from SubSystem named Maximo Application Suite Core.</div> |
