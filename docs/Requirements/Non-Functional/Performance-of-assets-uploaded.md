### Theme

Performance





### Context

Continuous meters can help you get the most from your assets by keeping track of usage and driving preventive.  Where possible, use exact meter readings (in lieu of averages) to ensure accuracy.  Averages are only estimates, and estimates are only good for forecasts.  Gauge meters will track changes in asset condition and characteristic meters can be used to record observations.  Ask the following questions: (1) Do your assets have instrumentation?  What would the cost be if they do not? (2) If so, Do your assets have instrumentation and are they fed into Meter readings? (3) Are safety plans assigned to assets? (4)  Do you maintain the specifications of an asset over its lifetime?





### Value

Meter and instrumentation allow you to move from preventive to predictive maintenance by generating work orders based on condition - not based on a schedule.
