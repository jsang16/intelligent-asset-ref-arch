### Description

Determine or define the linear assets needs of the customer--what they are using versus what they've purchased.




### Theme

Manageability





### Context

Linear assets are assets that are defined by length to accurately depict such things as highways, roads, railway tracks, pipelines, or power-lines with their length directly impacting their maintenance.  Linear assets have a start and end point that can be defined using various units of measure such as miles, kilometers, feet etc. Ask the following questions:  Do you have assets that need to be managed linearly?  Do you have a definition of serialized items? 





### Value

Linear assets are needed when a defect needs to be recorded, work performed, or meter readings taken at a measured point or span along the linear asset. Linear assets play a critical part in determining where maintenance work is performed.
